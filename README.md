🎧 Spotify & YouTube Music Data Analysis (Python)

This project analyzes a combined dataset of Spotify streams and YouTube video performance to uncover trends, top-performing tracks, artists, album types, and user engagement patterns.

Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), this analysis answers several real-world questions related to music consumption and audience behavior.

📌 Objectives

This analysis focuses on solving the following questions:

Q1. Top 10 Artists with the Highest Views on YouTube
Q2. Top 10 Tracks with the Highest Streams on Spotify
Q3. Most Common Album Types & Track Count per Album Type
Q4. Comparison of Average Likes, Views & Comments for Each Album Type
Q5. Top 5 YouTube Channels Based on Views
Q6. Track with the Highest Views
Q7. Top 7 Tracks with the Highest Like-to-View Ratio
Q8. Albums Having Tracks with Maximum Danceability
Q9. Correlation Between Likes, Comments, Views & Spotify Streams

Each question is answered using data cleaning, grouping, sorting, and visualization.
